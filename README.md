The game is an exciting and suspense-filled dice game designed for two players. In this game, each player takes turns to roll a dice, adding the number rolled to their total score. The goal is to be the first to reach a sum of 100. However, thereâ€™s a twist! If a player rolls a 1, their total score gained during the particular round resets to zero, adding an element of risk and unpredictability to the game. This game not only provides entertainment but also encourages strategic thinking as players must decide when to roll the dice and when to pass their turn to avoid the risk of losing their accumulated points.
